## Summary
3.19.20

I began participating in a 'Software Development Mastermind' mentorship program towards the end of 2019. The purpose of the program is to strengthen and expand my skills as a Full Stack developer. The completed work is showcased on my GitHub and portfolio/personal website.

This Fantasy Stock Market is a Full Stack app and the fifth and last project of the series. Here I learned to deploy a .Net + React app to Azure, use .Net Core, Type Script, Front and Back End JWT and Tokens to protect the APIs.

My ultimate goal is to land a job that incorporates my skills and utilizes my abilities and outgoing personality. So if you enjoyed reviewing my code as much as I did writing it, please find me on one of the links provided below.
